      <div>
        <p>The reading section is designed to test how will you interpret and understand academic
            texts. You will read two passages and answer 14 questions on each passage.</p>
        <p>In an official TOEFL exam, youâ€™ll be given 20 minutes to complete each passage and
            set of questions associated with that passage. Therefore, try to complete both passages
            and questions within 40 minutes. </p>
        <p>Each question is worth 1 point, except the final question in each set of questions. The
            directions in the final question will note the point worth of the question.</p>
        <p>In the official TOEFL reading section, you are able to skip questions and come back
            to them later, so keep track of your timing per question. Except the final question, try to
            answer each question in less than one minute, otherwise, skip the question and come
            back to finish it later.</p>
