# TOEFL_AI Project

## Overview

The TOEFL_AI project is designed to assist users in preparing for the TOEFL exam by providing various tools and resources. This project includes HTML, CSS, Python, and database files, each serving a specific purpose in the overall functionality of the application.

## HTML Files

### index.html
The `index.html` file serves as the main entry point for the application. It provides the initial user interface, including navigation links to other sections of the application. The file includes placeholders for dynamic content that will be populated using JavaScript.

### practice.html
The `practice.html` file is dedicated to the practice section of the application. It contains the structure for displaying practice questions, input fields for user responses, and buttons for submitting answers. This file is designed to be interactive, allowing users to engage with practice questions in a user-friendly manner.

### results.html
The `results.html` file displays the results of the user's practice sessions. It includes sections for showing scores, feedback, and suggestions for improvement. This file is essential for providing users with insights into their performance and areas where they need to focus more.

## CSS Files

### styles.css
The `styles.css` file contains the main styling rules for the application. It ensures a consistent look and feel across all HTML pages by defining styles for common elements such as headers, footers, buttons, and forms. The file also includes responsive design rules to ensure the application is accessible on various devices.

### practice.css
The `practice.css` file is specifically tailored for the practice section of the application. It includes styles for question containers, input fields, and interactive elements. This file ensures that the practice section is visually appealing and easy to navigate.

### results.css
The `results.css` file provides styling for the results page. It includes styles for score displays, feedback messages, and suggestion lists. This file ensures that the results are presented in a clear and organized manner, making it easy for users to understand their performance.

## Python Files

### app.py
The `app.py` file is the main backend script for the application. It handles routing, data processing, and interaction with the database. This file includes functions for serving HTML pages, processing user inputs, and generating results based on user performance.

"""
app.py

This module contains the main application logic for the project. It includes the following functions:

1. `create_app()`: Initializes and configures the Flask application.
2. `configure_database(app)`: Sets up the database configuration for the Flask application.
3. `register_blueprints(app)`: Registers all the blueprints with the Flask application.
4. `initialize_extensions(app)`: Initializes any Flask extensions used in the application.
5. `configure_logging(app)`: Configures logging for the Flask application.
6. `handle_errors(app)`: Sets up custom error handlers for the Flask application.

Each function plays a crucial role in setting up and running the Flask application, ensuring that all necessary components are properly configured and integrated.

### database.py
The `database.py` file contains functions for interacting with the database. It includes methods for storing user data, retrieving practice questions, and saving user responses. This file ensures that all data operations are performed efficiently and securely.

### analysis.py
The `analysis.py` file is responsible for analyzing user performance. It includes algorithms for calculating scores, generating feedback, and identifying areas for improvement. This file plays a crucial role in providing users with meaningful insights into their practice sessions.

## Database Files

### schema.sql
The `schema.sql` file defines the structure of the database. It includes SQL statements for creating tables, defining relationships, and setting up indexes. This file ensures that the database is properly structured to support the application's data requirements.

### seed.sql
The `seed.sql` file contains SQL statements for populating the database with initial data. It includes sample practice questions, answers, and user data. This file is essential for setting up the application with a baseline dataset that users can interact with.

### queries.sql
The `queries.sql` file includes common SQL queries used by the application. It contains statements for retrieving practice questions, storing user responses, and fetching results. This file ensures that all database interactions are performed using optimized and secure queries.

## Conclusion
